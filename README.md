Welcome to the WebcamJs POC!

In this POC Project, we will see how to capture an image/snapshot/Photo from a web camera (WebCam) using Asp.Net Core MVC C#. In order to capture an image from a webcam,
we need to use the "Webcam.js" javascript library, the source code of this library is found in https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs. 

We are going to create a simple ASP.NET core application and integrate the "Webcam.js" javascript library to capture the image from your web camera.
And we are storing it in Local Storage of your hosted machine, You can access that image and upload it on any cloud service providers like Amazon AWS, Azure Storage etc.
